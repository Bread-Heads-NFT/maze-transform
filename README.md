# maze-transform

Inspired by a particular Computerphile video about solving mazes.
Takes in a 2D array of booleans (True => path, False => wall) and
returns an optimised (least nodes required to traverse the maze)
graph. The plan is to optimise this graph creation as much as possible.

### plans

 - actually write this
 - prove it correct
 - make it fast
 - make the solving algorithm online (solve as you read, generate
 the nodes lazily?)
